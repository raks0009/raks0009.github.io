2) Research Assistant at the Applied and Environmental Biotechnology Laboratory Laboratory, BITS Goa. Working on a State Govt. of Jharkhand project to create a database and document all major wetlands in the state using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools, and valuing them using <a href='https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest'>InVEST</a> models.
