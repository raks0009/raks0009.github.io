Right now, I'm working on the following projects:

<br/>
1) Translation Validation of Scheduled Conditional Behavior using Petri Net based Program Models

<br/>
2) Machine Learning Methods for Sleep-Stage Classification using MoMaMeMi filtered brainwaves.

<br/>
3) Formal documentation for SamaTulyataII, a Petri net based equivalence checking tool.

<br/>
4) Validation of Feature Model Configuration using Classical Petri Nets and Invariants.



<br/>
These are my personal projects; I am working on some other collaborators' projects as well, which I don't have the right to mention here. 

Hit me up if you would like to know more or get involved! Collaborators, guidance and ideas are always welcome.
