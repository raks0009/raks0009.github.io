2) Machine Learning Methods for Sleep-Stage Classification using MoMaMeMi filtered brainwaves.

<br/>
3) Validating feature configurations using Petri nets.

<br/>
4) Translation validation using Petri nets.


### Projects I'm contributing to as a Collaborator

<br/>
1) Working Group 1 (Foundations) : EU COST Action: IC1404 <a href ="http://mpm4cps.eu/">MPM4CPS</a> (Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems)

<br/>
2) Research intern in the INFRES departement at Telecom Paris. Associated with the ACMoM (Architecture-Centric Model Management Project). Creating a set of classes for a reverse-mapping (uninstantiation) of AADL objects.
