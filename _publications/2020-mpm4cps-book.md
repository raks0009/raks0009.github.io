This book is the result of a cooperation made possible by the COST Action IC1404 ”Multi-Paradigm Modeling for Cyber-Physical Systems” (MPM4CPS),that allowed the collaboration of researchers, institutions and companies from 32 countries over 4 years. The goal of this book is to serve as a showcase of the research outcomes of the different workgroups of the MPM4CPS network. As such, the book is expected to cover the results on the foundations, formalisms, tools and educational resources produced within the MPM4CPS network (e.g.  case studies made available by the MPM4CPS network).  The text focuses on state-of-the-art research and practice knowledge.
