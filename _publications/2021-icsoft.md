Software applications often require the transformation of an input source program into a translated one for optimization. In this process, preserving the semantics across the transformation also called equivalence checking is essential. In this paper, we present ongoing work on a novel translation validation technique for handling loop transformations such as loop swapping and distribution, which cannot be handled  by state-of-the-art  equivalence checkers. The method makes use of a reduced size Petri net model integrating SMT solvers for validating arithmetic transformations. The approach is illustrated with two simple programs and further validated with a programs benchmark.
