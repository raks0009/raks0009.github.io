title: "Low-Power Hardware Accelerator for Detrending Measured Biopotential Data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-08-22-amamemi
excerpt: 'This paper describes the architecture for the Adaptive-MaMeMi filter that can remove various low-frequency noises from biopotential signals. The Adaptive-MaMeMi filter is an adaption of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809415001032">MaMeMi filter</a>. The single hardware accelerator, implemented on a Xilinx FPGA using hardware-software co-design techniques, can detrend various different biopotentials.'
