Today’s systems are often highly configurable requiring to model them as product lines. For this, feature modeling has been developed to capture the aspects 
of commonality and variability of systems, which are then represented as configurations of feature models. Validating such configurations is therefore an important 
topic. Yet, existing approaches have several limitations such as scalability issues for large systems and system families and cannot handle the different feature 
modeling language variants or extensions that have been proposed. We present our ongoing work on a novel approach to validate feature model configurations by 
translating them to Petri Nets. The approach can handle extended models of extended feature modeling languages and proposes an incremental validation scheme.
