High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools and schedulers are large and complex systems. More often than not, they are developed without formal proofs. In spite of rigorous testing, bugs do occur in these tools. These bugs may result in generation a target code that is not semantically equivalent to the original code. Ensuring the correctness of the translations performed by these HLS tools like compilers and schedulers is necessary for their reliability. Translation validation is the process of verifying that the target code generated by these translations of the HLS tools is semantically equivalent to the original code. Our paper targets the translation validation of the scheduling phase of these HLS tools.
